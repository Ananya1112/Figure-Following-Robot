# Figure-Following-Robot

The main aim of making this project is to make few working fields easier, efficient, economically feasible, omnipresent and portable. 

The bot will be controlled by the user by drawing the any required path in the interface.

The working of bot includes given stages:

1. The required path will be drawn by the user in python interface.
2. The coordinates of the figure at some interval will be generated which will be sent to the Arduino Uno.
3. The bot will trace the drawn figure according to the distance and relative angle measurement between the coordinates.
